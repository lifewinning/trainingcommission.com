The interview archive central to the plot of _The Training Commission_ is a collection of real interviews conducted by Ingrid Burrington in 2019 with Patrick Ball, Jeff Deutch, Alexa Koenig, Eden Medina, Richard Rodgers, and Jamie Rowen. Each of the interviews is available as PDFs below, in the same format they appeared in the narrative. Our tremendous thaks to all of them for their insights and willingness to be part of this experimental project.
